# Twenty Nineteen Hugo

This is a port of the WordPress Twenty Nineteen theme to Hugo. It's a work in progress right now.

## Installation Instructions

`git submodule whatever`

## Highlights

- Accent color configurable via config.toml
- Featured image treatment using accent color works (maybe???)
- Social menu in header actually renders the icon (maybe???)
- Search via Fuse.js included
- Google Analytics code configurable via config.toml

## Differences from original theme

- Comment related stuff has been omitted
- Author related stuff has been omitted
- The article lists show summaries rather than full content
